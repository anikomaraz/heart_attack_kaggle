    <h3>Quick Summary</h3>

    **:green[The Challenge]:** This project was inspired by the [Heart Attack Risk Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/heart-attack-risk-analysis/overview) competition on Kaggle, with predictions submitted to an ongoing challenge. 
    The task was to predict heart attack risk (low/high) given 25 features of lifestyle and biometrics. 
    After preprocessing the data, I trained and evaluated 7 machine learning models, fine-tuned the best performing ones and achieved a placement of :blue-background[46th in the Kaggle competition]. 
    
    **:green[Focus on Precision]:**
    The Kaggle competition was scored on model _accuracy_ that reflects the model's ability to correctly label both true and false cases. 
    However, in this particular case, missing a high-risk (positive) case of heart attack could be fatal. 
    To mitigate this risk and ensure high-risk cases are captured as diligently as possible, I prioritized :blue-background[**precision** as a measure of goodness of fit]. 
    Optimizing for precision allows for more sensitive detection of high-risk cases in production, potentially saving lives. 
    
    
    **:green[Model and Evaluation]:** To further enhance the model's sensitivity, I opted for :blue-background[probability estimation] and found the best-scoring model on precision to be the :blue-background[XGBoost] model. Following fine-tuning this model achieved a precision of 0.4286. 
    This means that if the model identifies a positive case, it is :blue-background[**correct 43% of the time**] (precision), meaning it will give a false alarm 57% of the time.
    
    **:green[Model Deployment]:** After several iterations, the project culminated in deployment on :blue-background[Google Cloud Platform] with a Streamlit frontend.
