    <h3>Quick Summary</h3>

    This project was inspired by the [Heart Attack Risk Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/heart-attack-risk-analysis/overview) competition on Kaggle, with predictions submitted to an ongoing challenge. 
    The task was to predict heart attack risk (low/high) given 25 features of lifestyle and biometrics. Focusing on precision, I built and deployed my own model which is currently running in production on this website. I will provide a quick summary of the app's features the following phases, steps and highlights. Please look for the [Technical Summary](https://fake-heart-attack.streamlit.app/Technical_summary) for details on preprocessing, modelling and evaluation.

    1. **Exploratory Data Analysis and Preprocessing:**
       - Explored the dataset thoroughly to uncover patterns and distributions ([see notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/anikomaraz/heart_attack_kaggle/blob/main/notebooks/heart_attack_v3_clean_KaggleV1.ipynb)).
       - Implemented extensive preprocessing including feature engineering, encoding, normalization, and balancing to prepare the data for modeling.

    2. **Model Development and Optimization:**
       - Trained and evaluated seven machine learning models including Logistic Regression, XGBoost, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
       - Hyperparameter-tuned the XGBoost, SVM, and the Neural Network models to improve performance metrics.

    3. **Focus on Precision:**
       - However, I argue that the cost of missing truly high-risk cases is high, therefore **precision** is a more suitable metric of model performance.
       - The model with the highest precision was **XGBoost**.
       - To further enhance detection and to account for the lack of positive predictions on the test set, I employed **probability estimation** and found an optimal threshold to increase sensitivity.
       - This strategic adjustment resulted in a higher sensitivity for risk assessment, therefore a better detection for high-risk heart attack cases.
       - Documentation can be found in [this notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/anikomaraz/heart_attack_kaggle/blob/main/notebooks/heart_attack_v5_probability_xgboost_KaggleV2.ipynb).

    ### Model Deployment
    - The project evolved through multiple versions, culminating in a deployed application hosted on **Google Cloud Platform** with a Streamlit frontend.
