    <h3>Quick Summary</h3>

    This project was inspired by the [Heart Attack Risk Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/heart-attack-risk-analysis/overview) competition on Kaggle, with predictions submitted to an ongoing challenge. The task was to predict heart attack risk (low/high) given 25 features of lifestyle and biometrics. Focusing on precision, I developed and deployed my own model currently in production on this website. Below is a quick summary of the app's key phases, steps, and highlights. For detailed information on preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation, refer to the [Technical Summary](https://fake-heart-attack.streamlit.app/Technical_summary).

    1. **Exploratory Data Analysis and Preprocessing:**
       - I thoroughly explored the dataset to uncover patterns and distributions ([notebook link](https://nbviewer.org/github/anikomaraz/heart_attack_kaggle/blob/main/notebooks/heart_attack_v3_clean_KaggleV1.ipynb)).
       - Extensive preprocessing included feature engineering, encoding, normalization, and balancing to prepare data for modeling.

    2. **Model Development and Optimization:**
       - Trained and evaluated seven machine learning models: Logistic Regression, XGBoost, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
       - Hyperparameter-tuned XGBoost, SVM, and Neural Network models to enhance performance metrics.

    3. **Focus on Precision:**
       - I advocate that precision is a better metric than accuracy in this case. Detecting high-risk cases is crucial, which should be the focus of this model instead of classification accuracy as suggested by the competition.
       - Therefore, I optimized model performance for precision and identified **XGBoost** as the highest performing model.
       - Given the low number of predicted positive cases on the test set, I utilized **probability estimation** to adjust sensitivity thresholds, resulting in improved high-risk heart attack detection.
       - Refer to [this notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/anikomaraz/heart_attack_kaggle/blob/main/notebooks/heart_attack_v5_probability_xgboost_KaggleV2.ipynb) for detailed documentation.

    4. **Model Evaluation**
       - If the model identifies a positive case, it is correct **43% of the time** (=precision).

    ### Model Deployment
    - The project progressed through multiple iterations, culminating in deployment on **Google Cloud Platform** with a Streamlit frontend.
