    <h3>Quick Summary</h3>

    This project was inspired by the [Heart Attack Risk Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/heart-attack-risk-analysis/overview) competition on Kaggle, with predictions submitted to an ongoing challenge. The task was to predict heart attack risk (low/high) given 25 features of lifestyle and biometrics. However, I decided develop a better model, that focus on identifying high-risk cases (optimise for precision) instead of correctly identifying all cases (optimised for accuracy, as required by Kaggle). Below is a quick summary of the app's key phases, steps, and highlights. For detailed information on preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation, refer to the [Technical Summary](https://fake-heart-attack.streamlit.app/Technical_summary).

    **Exploratory Data Analysis and Preprocessing:**
    During this phase, I thoroughly explored the dataset to understand distributions and identify missing data. I applied extensive [preprocessing techniques](https://nbviewer.org/github/anikomaraz/heart_attack_kaggle/blob/main/notebooks/heart_attack_v3_clean_KaggleV1.ipynb) including feature engineering, encoding, normalization, and balancing to prepare the data for modeling. 

    **Model Development and Optimization:**
    The project involved training and evaluating seven machine learning models: Logistic Regression, XGBoost, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks. I hyperparameter-tuned the best-performing models, achieving a placement of 46th in the Kaggle competition with a moderate model accuracy of 63.776%. 

    **Focus on Precision:**
    This is where my project took a significant turn. I believe that **precision** is a much better metric for measuring model performance than accuracy (as used by Kaggle). Detecting high-risk cases is crucial because misclassification (i.e., labeling high-risk cases as low-risk) can potentially cost lives. Therefore, I prioritized increasing precision over accuracy. I identified **XGBoost** as the highest-performing model and optimized its parameters for the best performance.

    Furthermore, I noticed that the most accurate models (those placing in the top 5+ in the competition) failed to predict any positive cases in the 1,710 test cases, despite 35% of the training data (N=7,035) being labeled as high-risk. To address this, I enhanced my model's sensitivity by applying **probability estimation** and tuning the threshold. This resulted in a 5% improvement in detection. For detailed documentation, refer to [this notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/anikomaraz/heart_attack_kaggle/blob/main/notebooks/heart_attack_v5_probability_xgboost_KaggleV2.ipynb).

    **Model Evaluation:**
    If the model identifies a positive case, it is correct **43% of the time** (precision), meaning it will give a false alarm 57% of the time. 

    ### Model Deployment:
    After several iterations, the project culminated in deployment on **Google Cloud Platform** with a Streamlit frontend. For comprehensive code, versioning, and visualizations, please visit the [Technical Summary](https://fake-heart-attack.streamlit.app/Technical_summary) on this website.
