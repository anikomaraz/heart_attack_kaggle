    "So. The EDA profiler tells us is that we have 26 variables (25 features + 1 target variable of low/high risk) and 7010 patients in rows. There is no missing data or duplicate rows, meaning each record is unique, which is great. We have 16 categorical and 9 numberical variables, plus a geo variable as a bonus (South/North hemisphere). \n",

    "Looking closer at the data, there seem to be 2 distinct type of measures / features: \n",
    "1. __biomarkers__ such as Blood Pressure, Family History, Diabetes, Previous Heart Problems and partially Medication Use, AND\n",
    "2. __behavioural indicatiors__ such as Smoking, Obesity, Alcohol Consumption and Physical Activity (Days per week)\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean __age__ is 54 years with a standard deviation of 21 years, and a range of 18-90, which nicely covers the general population characteristics. In terms of __sex__ about two-thirds are men, the rest is female. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mean __Cholesterol__ levels are at 260, which is above the normal value of 240, although this measure has a high variability (standard deviation = 81) and an almost bimodal distribution (values centering at 250 and 355 with a \"valley\" at 320). __Blood Pressure__ has to be mined, as the format is currently not suitable for analysis (i.e. 159/105). The mean of __Heart Rate__ is around 75 (std: 21, 40-110) which is again in the normal range. Noteworty is the bimodal distribution of this measure, with centers around 50 and 70 (valley at 72). \n",
    "__Diabetes__ is represented as a bivariate measure, with about 2/3rds of the sample having diabetes. __Family History__, __Obesity__ and __Previous Heart Problems__ each take two values, about half of the participants being obese, having previously heart problems, and also half reporting positive value for heart attack in the family. A suprisingly large proportion, about 90% of the sample report __Smoking__. Most of them (65%) reports __Alcohol Consumption__. After such high proportions of \"unhealthy behaviour\" the patients suprisingly report a mean __Exercise__ of 10 hours per week (std: 5.8, 0-20 hrs). In terms of __Diet__, there are equal proportions of Health, Average and Unhealth dieters. Although there is no information on which kind of __Medication__ patients take, half of them report using. __Stress Levels__ are approximately equally distributed among 10 possible categories. In terms of __Sleep__, there is a large variation in the data: the mean is 6 hours, ranging between 0.001 (?!) and 12 hours. __Income__ centers around 158.000 USD a year, which indicates the sample being well, pretty rich - over twice as high than the average yearly salary in 2023. __BMI__ may also be an important indicator: the mean is 29, with a standard deviation of 6.3 indicating general population levels. In terms of __Triglycerides__, the mean is around 416 (data are approximately equally distributed between 30 and 800), which indicates high levels compared to the normal being less than 150mg/dL. __Physical Activity__ ranges equally between 0 and 7 days a week as well as __Sleep Hours Per Day__ (ranging between 4 and 10 but in almost fully equal proportions in the sample). In terms of __Country__ most patients come from \"Otherland\", the rest being distributed accross the world and accross __Continents__ with Europe and Asia being the most represented. This also leads to the fact that most patients (about 70%) live on the Northern __Hemisphere__. Finally, our target variable: 35% has a high __risk for heart attack__, and 65% has low risk. \n",
